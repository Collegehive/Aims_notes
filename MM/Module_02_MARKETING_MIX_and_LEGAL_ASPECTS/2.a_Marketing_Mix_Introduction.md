# Marketing Mix Overview

The marketing mix is a foundational concept in marketing used to consider the different factors that marketers can control to meet customer needs in a targeted market. The concept is best known through the four P's: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion.

## Origin of the Marketing Mix

The term "marketing mix" was first proposed by Neil Borden in the early 1950s. Borden was an advertising professor at Harvard University. He started using the term inspired by James Culliton, who in the 1940s described the marketing manager as a "mixer of ingredients." Later, on that **E. Jerome McCarthy**, another marketing professor, developed the concept further by categorizing the mix into four major components: Product, Price, Place, and Promotion, which became widely popular as the 4 Ps.
