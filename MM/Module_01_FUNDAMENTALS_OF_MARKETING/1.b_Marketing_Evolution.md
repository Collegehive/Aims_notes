# Marketing Myopia

Marketing myopia is a concept introduced by the renowned marketing scholar, Theodore Levitt, in his 1960 article published in the Harvard Business Review. It refers to the tendency of businesses to focus too narrowly on their products or services, rather than on the broader needs and desires of their customers.

## Definition
Marketing myopia is defined as the short-sighted and product-centric approach to marketing, where companies fail to recognize the changing needs and preferences of their target market. This narrow focus often leads to the neglect of long-term customer satisfaction and the inability to adapt to market changes, ultimately resulting in the decline or stagnation of the business.

## Explanation
When companies suffer from marketing myopia, they tend to define their business in terms of the products or services they offer, rather than the needs they are trying to fulfill. This can lead to a myopic view of the market, where the company becomes overly focused on its internal operations and loses sight of the evolving needs and desires of its customers.

For example, a company that produces typewriters might define its business as "making typewriters" rather than "providing efficient writing solutions." This narrow perspective can blind the company to the changing market dynamics, such as the rise of personal computers and word processing software, which ultimately render the typewriter obsolete.

## Consequences of Marketing Myopia
The consequences of marketing myopia can be severe and far-reaching for businesses:

1. **Declining Market Share**: By failing to adapt to changing customer needs, companies with a myopic approach often lose market share to more customer-centric competitors.

2. **Reduced Innovation**: Myopic companies tend to focus on incremental product improvements rather than exploring new, innovative solutions that could better meet customer needs.

3. **Diminished Customer Loyalty**: When companies fail to understand and address the evolving needs of their customers, they risk losing customer loyalty and trust.

4. **Stagnation and Decline**: Ultimately, marketing myopia can lead to the stagnation and eventual decline of a business, as it becomes increasingly disconnected from the market it serves.
