## Meaning of Induction

Induction is the process through which new employees are introduced to their roles and the organization. According to Pigors and Myers, induction is "the determination of the job to which an accepted candidate is to be assigned, and his assignment to that job. It matches what the supervisor thinks the employee can do with the job demands, including strain and working conditions."

## Need for Induction

Induction is crucial for ensuring that new employees integrate effectively within the organization. Well-structured induction programs are beneficial for both employers and employees by:

- Reducing employee turnover.
- Decreasing absenteeism.
- Increasing commitment from new hires.
- Enhancing job satisfaction and overall morale.

## Features of Induction

1. **Job First Man Next**
   - The principle emphasizes placing the employee in a position that suits the job requirements rather than modifying the job to fit the employee's qualifications.

2. **Placement According to Qualification**
   - Employees are assigned roles that match their qualifications to ensure they are neither under-challenged nor overburdened.

3. **Familiarization**
   - New employees are introduced to the working conditions, company culture, and the rules and regulations of the organization.

4. **Developing Sense of Loyalty**
   - Induction programs aim to foster loyalty and cooperation among new hires, helping them understand their responsibilities and align their goals with those of the organization.

5. **Ready Placement**
   - Ensures that new employees are placed in their roles as soon as they join the organization, allowing them to start contributing immediately.

6. **Temporary Placement**
   - Initially, placements might be temporary, with permanent positions assigned after completion of necessary training or evaluation periods.
