## Detailed Explanation

### Induction Training
Induction training, also known as orientation, is the initial training session for a new employee that aims to familiarize them with the organizational environment and culture. This type of training is crucial for helping new hires integrate smoothly into the company and understand their roles and responsibilities within the broader organizational framework. It typically occurs once at the beginning of an employee's tenure and can be conducted inside or outside the workplace.

### On-job Training
On-job training is a practical approach where employees are trained in their actual work environment while they perform their job duties. This method is beneficial for both new and existing employees as it directly enhances their skills and efficiency on specific tasks they are or will be engaged in. Unlike induction training, on-job training can occur multiple times as it is often necessary to update or upgrade an employee's skills due to changes in technology, processes, or roles.

## Conclusion

While both types of training are essential for employee development, they serve different purposes and setups. Induction training is about acclimating to the company, whereas on-job training is focused on continuous skill improvement.
