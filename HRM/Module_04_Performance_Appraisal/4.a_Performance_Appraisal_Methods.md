# Performance Appraisal: Meaning, Definitions, Objectives, and Methods

## Meaning
**Performance appraisal** refers to the regular review of an employee's job performance and overall contribution to a company. Also known as an annual review, performance review or evaluation, or employee appraisal, this process evaluates an employee's skills, achievements, and growth, or lack thereof.

Employees are the real assets of a company, not just its infrastructure or profits. Companies that understand the value of their employees rarely face significant losses. Thus, keeping employees motivated and satisfied is crucial. Performance appraisals are part of this effort, providing recognition and rewards for excellent performance.

## Definition
**Performance appraisal** is defined as a systematic process that measures an employee's personality and performance. This evaluation is typically conducted by managers or immediate supervisors against predefined attributes like skill set, knowledge about the role, technical know-how, attitude, punctuality, and more.

Performance appraisal may be known by various names across organizations, such as performance evaluation, performance review, merit rating, or annual reviews.
