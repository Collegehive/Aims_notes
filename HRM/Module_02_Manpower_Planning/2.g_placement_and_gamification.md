# Meaning and Features of Placement

## Meaning of Placement

According to Pigors and Myers, **placement** is defined as the determination of the job to which an accepted candidate is to be assigned, and his assignment to that job. It involves a careful matching of what the supervisor believes the employee can handle with the demands of the job, as well as considerations of the strains and working conditions imposed by the job.

## Features of Placement

Placement is a crucial step in the recruitment process, ensuring that new hires are effectively integrated into their roles and the organization. The following are key features of effective placement:

1. **Job First Man Next**
   - The principle that the requirements of the job should dictate the placement of the employee, not the other way around. The job should not be adjusted to fit the qualifications or requirements of the employee, emphasizing the priority of job needs.

2. **Placement According to Qualification**
   - Employees should be placed in positions that match their qualifications. It is important that the placement neither overshoots nor undershoots an employee's qualifications to ensure effectiveness and satisfaction on the job.

3. **Familiarization**
   - Newly placed employees should be made familiar with the working conditions, practices, and culture prevailing in the organization. Additionally, they need to be informed about the rules and regulations pertinent to their roles, which aids in smoother integration into the workplace.

4. **Developing Sense of Loyalty**
   - It is crucial to foster a sense of loyalty and cooperation among new employees. Effective placement practices can help new hires understand and commit to their responsibilities towards the job and the organization, thereby enhancing job satisfaction and organizational loyalty.

5. **Ready Placement**
   - Once an employee joins the organization, they should be placed immediately. Effective placement means having a role ready for the new hire from their first day, ensuring that there is no delay in their contribution to the organization.

6. **Temporary Placement**
   - Initially, placement might be temporary, especially if further adjustments are required post-training. This flexibility allows the employee to transition to a role where they can be most effective after gaining a clearer understanding of their job and the organization.

## Conclusion

Effective placement is vital for both the employee and the organization as it ensures that every new hire is positioned in a role that maximizes their potential and meets organizational needs. By adhering to these principles, organizations can enhance job satisfaction, reduce turnover rates, and improve overall productivity.
