Recruitment sources are categorized into two main types: Internal and External Sources.

### Internal Sources of Recruitment

Internal sources involve recruiting candidates from within the organization. This may include current employees, former employees, or anyone who previously had a work relationship with the organization.

**Advantages**:

- Higher morale and motivation among employees due to internal growth opportunities.
- Cost-effective compared to external recruitment.

**Characteristics**:
- Faster and cheaper than external recruitment.
- Limits hiring to the existing workforce, potentially stifling innovation.
- Can lead to job stagnation if not managed properly.

**Limitations**:
- May not always bring new skills or ideas into the organization.
- Risk of nepotism or bias in promotions or transfers.

### External Sources of Recruitment

External recruitment involves sourcing candidates from outside the organization. This can be achieved through various methods:

1. **Recommendations**: Employees or other contacts recommend candidates.
2. **Employment Agencies and Job Boards**: Websites like naukri.com, or government-run employment exchanges.
3. **Advertising**: Using media to announce openings.
4. **Educational Institutions**: Campus recruitments.
5. **Contractors**: Hiring through outsourcing.
6. **Unskilled Labor**: Direct recruitment or through agencies.
7. **Applications Pool**: Considering previously received applications.
8. **Temporary Workers**: Hiring from staffing agencies.

## Conclusion

Recruitment plays a critical role in shaping the workforce of an organization. Both internal and external sources of recruitment have unique benefits and limitations. Balancing these sources effectively is key to developing a dynamic and skilled workforce that aligns with the strategic goals of the organization.
